# PRODIGY_SD_04
# CONTACT MANAGEMENT

## Project Title
A concise and descriptive title for my project “Contact Management System”.

## Technologies Used
	• Programming Language(s): C / C++ / Python / JavaScript
	• Frameworks: Flask / Django / React (if applicable)
	• Libraries: Requests, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Bootstrap
	• Tools: Git, VS Code, Postman, etc.

## Features
	•  Add new records (e.g., contacts, products, tasks)
	• View stored data in a structured format
	•  Edit existing entries
	•  Delete entries when no longer needed
	•  Persistent storage (file or database)
	•  User-friendly interface (CLI, Web, or GUI)

## Process
	1. Planning: Defined the scope and requirements of the project.
	2. Design: Structured the data model and user interface.
	3. Implementation: Wrote the core logic and integrated libraries/frameworks.
	4. Testing: Debugged errors and validated functionality.
	5. Deployment: Hosted locally or online (GitHub Pages, Heroku, etc.).

## What I Learned
	• How to structure a project for clarity and scalability.
	• Practical use of libraries/frameworks for automation and web development.
	• Importance of clean UI/UX and documentation.
	• Debugging and iterative improvement based on feedback.
	• Version control with Git and GitHub.

## How It Could Be Improved
	• Add search functionality (e.g., search contacts by name/phone/email).
	• Integrate a database (SQLite/PostgreSQL) instead of file storage.
	• Build a web-based interface for easier access.
	• Implement authentication for secure usage.
	• Enhance UI with modern frameworks (React, TailwindCSS).
